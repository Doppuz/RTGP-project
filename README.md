# About The Project
This project is about creating an infinite procedural terrain developed with C ++ using OpenGL. It was developed for the Real-time Graphics and Programming course and I did it all by myself.

# Description
The terrain is composed by a number of cells which structure is modified by a random noise. Considering the position of the player, the cells are moved in the direction that he is moving to. The fog is used to hide this movement. On top of that, some aesthetic elements such as trees and cactus are added. (A small video can be watched on my website)
